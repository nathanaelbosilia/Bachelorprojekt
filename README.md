# Bachelorprojekt
This project implements an eShop system in both monolithic and microservices architectures to analyze their resilience. The microservices version consists of the modules ordering, shipping, and notification which communicate asynchronously via Kafka. Load and chaos tests evaluate the impact of asynchronous messaging on fault tolerance under stress.
